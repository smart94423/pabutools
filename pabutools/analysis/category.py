def category_proportionality(

) -> Numeric:
    """
    Computes the difference between the cost allocated per category, and that existing in the profile. More
    specifically, for each category (an error is raised if not category are specified) we compute the amount of money
    dedicated to projects from the category in the budget allocation; together with the amount of money allocated to
    the category in the ballots of the voters. For each category, the average between these two scores is raised to the
    power 2, the global average over all categories is then considered and we return the exponential of minus that
    value.

    It mostly makes sense for approval ballots, though any profile of ballots supporting the `in` operator can be used.

    Parameters
    ----------
        instance : :py:class:`~pabutools.election.instance.Instance`
            The instance.
        profile : :py:class:`~pabutools.election.profile.profile.AbstractProfile`
            The profile.
        budget_allocation : Iterable[:py:class:`~pabutools.election.instance.Project`]
            The selected collection of projects.

    Returns
    -------
        Numeric
            The score for the category proportionality.
