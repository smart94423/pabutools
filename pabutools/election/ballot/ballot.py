class AbstractBallot(ABC, Iterable[Project]):
    """
    Abstract class representing the ballots, i.e., the information submitted by the voters. Essentially used for
    type-hint purposes.

    Parameters
    ----------
        name : str, optional
            The identifier of the ballot.
            Defaults to `""`.
        meta : dict, optional
            Additional information concerning the ballot, stored in a dictionary. Keys and values are typically
            strings. Could for instance store the gender of the voter, their location etc.
            Defaults to `dict()`.

    Attributes
    ----------
        name : str
            The identifier of the ballot.
