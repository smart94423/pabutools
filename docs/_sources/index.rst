Pabutools: PB as easy as ABC
============================

(For the pun, see the awesome `ABC <https://github.com/martinlackner/abcvoting>`_)

The pabutools are a complete set of tools work with participatory budgeting instances.

Participatory budgeting (PB) is a democratic tool used to allocate a given amount of money
to a collection of projects based on a group of individuals' preferences over the projects.
It has been invented in Brazil in the late 80's and is now a widely implemented. See the
`Wikipedia page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_budgeting>`_ for more details.

In this library we provide the tools to handle PB instances of different kinds, together
with voting rules to determine the outcome of the elections and some analytic tools.
In particular, we provide full support for the instances taken from
`pabulib <http://pabulib.org>`_, the reference library when it comes to PB data.
