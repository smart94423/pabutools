Installation
============

Since the pabutools are hosted on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pabutools/>`_, the
installation should be as easy as:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install pabutools

You can also directly download the sources from our
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/pbvoting/pabutools>`_ if that seems easier to you.
